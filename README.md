# Computer-Graphics-Lab
The computer graphics lab project of Itay Har-Shuv - 3D zhed game

The game is an extention to the game zhed which can be found in google play or the app store. The extention is the implementation of the game over defferend 3D quad meshes.
The game were created via unity. In addition, to learn unity better, I desided to make the 2048 game and the 2D version of the game. After doing those games, I sterted implement the 3D game but only on grided cube. I that by creating differnt mesh for every cell, loacate it in the right place and adding the uv of the number/empty cell. I connected every cell to its neighbors made the cell open and so on. I added restart and undo buttons. After finishing implement the game on a grided cube, I made it for every quad mesh. This I did by uploading a quadmesh to blender, then put it through a code in python that gave me the list of vertecies and squares of the mesh. Via those lists I was able to create the mesh myself in unity and play the game in it.


**Week Progression**
week 1: Writing the game description page, start practice simple basics of unity

week 2: I had started implementing the 2D version of the game and made the grid and such. After a while, I desided to get a better understanding of unity by implementing 2048 game from a tuturial in youtube and finshed the 2048 implemention

week 3: I start and finished implementing the 2D version of Zhed after learning a little bit more about unity to learn and practice more. It can be seen under 2Dzhed - remastered. I can add restart button, undo button, more levels etc. But I want to move to the finel 3D virsion of the game.

week 4: I started implement the 3D virsion of the game, I've done a grided (on every face) cube that I can put numbers on it's cells.

week 5: No progress this week do to other obligations.

week 6: Upgrade the desine a little, made the cube roll with WDSA keys and made the cells open proparly with undo and restart buttons.

week 7: No progress this week do to other obligations.

week 8: No progress this week do to other obligations.

week 9: Added rotation via buttons

week 10: No progress this week do to other obligations.

week 11: No progress this week do to other obligations.

week 12: Added win cell and desined 7 levels

week 13: Made the posibility the play the game on every quad mesh surface
